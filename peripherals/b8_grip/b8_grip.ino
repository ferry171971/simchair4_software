/**
 * Simchair MKIII B8 stick firmware. The stick has 6 buttons and 2 8-bit analog
 * axes.
 *
 * Connect buttons as follow:
 *     POT BOARD VCC to PIN 10
 *     POT BOARD GND -> Arduino GND
 *     POT VRx -> A0
 *     POT VRy -> A1
 *     POT BOARD BUTTON – PIN 2
 *     TOP (TRIMMER) – between PIN 3 and GND
 *     MIDDLE (FIRE) – between PIN 4 and GND
 *     BOTTOM – between PIN 5 and GND
 *     TRIGGER INTERCOM – between PIN 6 and GND
 *     TRIGGER PTT (full press) – between PIN 7 and GND
 *     A4 (SDA) -> ethernet cable blue wire
 *     A5 (SCL) -> ethernet cable green-white wire
 *     VCC -> ethernet cable orange-white wire
 *     GND -> ethernet cable orange wire
